# Weighted-Grade-Calculator

First "Project" in Github. That's a simple weighted calculator, its function its to calculate a weighted average, each row consists in two fields, a value and a percengage. What's a weighted average? Remember when you need to calculate a average of two numbers? Ex. A(8,5) = 6.5 
All the numbers in a simple average weight the same, in this case 8 and 5 weight 50%. With a Weighted calculador you can asign a weight percentage to each number. Ex. 8 now weight 25%, and 5 weight 75%, now the average it's 5,75
